# NDVI and population density analysis: S√£o Paulo Metropolitan Region (RMSP), Brazil (2000‚Äì2022)

This repository contains the source code, data processing workflows, and visualization scripts developed for the scientific study on vegetation dynamics in the S√£o Paulo Metropolitan Region (RMSP), Brazil. The analysis investigates the temporal behavior of the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** and its correlation with **population density**, considering the years 2000, 2010, and 2022.

## üìÑ About the study
Urban vegetation is a critical factor for mitigating the environmental impacts of metropolitan growth, reducing air pollution, heat islands, and soil sealing, while improving urban quality of life. In this context, remote sensing and geoprocessing techniques were applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal evolution of vegetation cover in the RMSP.  

The methodological design follows the framework proposed by Ponzoni, Shimabukuro, & Kuplich (2012), integrating quantitative analysis (NDVI derivation and statistical correlation) and qualitative interpretation (GIS-based contextualization). The study also draws on Gupta et al. (2012), adapting a mixed-methods approach to explore the relationship between vegetation indices and demographic indicators.  

By combining multi-date Landsat imagery with IBGE demographic data, the research identifies priority areas for urban sustainability policies, where vegetation recovery and the creation of green infrastructure are most needed.  

## üìä Data sources
- NDVI (2000, 2010, 2022): Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-9 OLI-2 via [Climate Engine](https://climateengine.org/) (Google Earth Engine).
